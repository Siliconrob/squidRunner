--------
```
squidRunner [squid instance] [start|stop|status]

where squid instance is your named **squid instance** most likely simply **squid** unless running multiple squid instances on a single server.  Assumption that instance configuration file follows instance name i.e. **squid** uses configuration file of **squid.conf**
